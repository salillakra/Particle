# Particle System with Stroke Connections

A dynamic particle system implemented in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas. Particles move independently, creating visually appealing animations. Stroke connections appear between particles when they come within a certain proximity.

## Features

- **Particle Movement:** Randomized horizontal and vertical speeds create natural-looking particle motion.
- **Dynamic Strokes:** Strokes appear between particles when they are close, adding a connected visual effect.

## Demo

See the particle system in action with stroke connections in this [live demo](https://particle-kohl-nine.vercel.app/).

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/salillakra/particle.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

Adjust the number of particles, their radius, and the stroke connection threshold in the script to explore different visual effects. Experiment with colors and sizes for a personalized touch.
